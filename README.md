# Age Calculator

## Overview
This is a simple javascript Age Calculator using your birth year.
I'd just started praticing Javascript at this time and this project is to test my skills.

## Description
The calculator is designed to collect your **name** and **birth-year**. Then, it would print out a sentence, like "*Hello $name, you are $age years old now!*". There is also an option to reset the calculator so you coukd make other calculations as you wish.

## Work Process
* HTML page first.
* Necessary CSS styling such as *display*.
* Defined a *ageCalc()* function to calculate the age.
* Defined other functions for functionality.
